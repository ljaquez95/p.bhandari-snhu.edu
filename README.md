What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  - The problem that I was trying to create a program that is able to properly pull and provide class courses for students.
    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  - by taking each section on step at a time and carefully reviewing the rubic, it became easier to simplify and correctly intregrate the correct code. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  - I found that when I came to roadblocks, I needed to step away and rethink my strategy in order to continue with the project. 
    
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   - It allowed me to understand there are different ways to code and adjust your inital code to favor the outcome may be needed. 
   
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - When you have a code that runs properly, maintain the code is easy. In addition, being able to alter and adjust the code to include new material is then easier.
